## Description
The "ZED Capture" program was used to gather data points, (specially formatted) video and position "truths", in order to provide the "Ball Origin Spotter" (BOS) with sets of test data. BOS could then use a set of test data to perform multiple tests for various combinations of detection and positioning algorithms and trained ML models.
